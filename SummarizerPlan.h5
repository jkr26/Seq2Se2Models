What are the things I actually want to implement here for real?


1. Batching for speed!!!
2. Evaluation metrics (small-scale)
3. Skip connections for depth
4. Attention variants (temporal...?)
5. Coverage
6. Beam search (during inference, right?)
7. Adversarial loss for generation
8. Pointer and switch for OOV problem
